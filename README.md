## Technologies Used

The project leverages several open-source technologies:

- **Kafka**: An open-source distributed event streaming platform crucial for efficient data pipelines and streaming analytics.
- **PySpark**: An interface for Apache Spark in Python, supporting various Spark functionalities like Spark SQL, DataFrame, Streaming, MLlib (Machine Learning), and Spark Core.
- **InfluxDB**: An open-source time series database by InfluxData, suitable for storing and retrieving time series data in real-time applications.
- **Grafana**: An open-source analytics and visualization web application capable of generating charts, graphs, and alerts when connected to compatible data sources.
- **Chronograf**: A web application developed by InfluxData as part of the InfluxDB project, facilitating data visualization and exploration.
